> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This is a private binary distribution that has yet to go opensource.   This is because we are currently testing the product.

*The purpose of this release is to run Docker containers as local code*, and it is leveraged to run a multitude of Docker Image projects on Mac/Linux/Windows.
It is currently utilized to run commands such as the github CLI:

`sd-run child -i gh -- gh <args>`

The primary goal of the project is to provide reliable toolchains across multiple operating systems, without the complexity associated with running the Docker Client for each project.
It automatically does a lot of scaffolding so that the user can focus on development.

More on the functionality will be provided soon, as we intend to release the full repository and documentation once we are in beta.
